Meeting Notes:

-------------

Notes:  

* For cohorts, we need to drop (or account for) first and last observed death age (only half true value due to truncation / lexis triangle subtlety)
* For real data â€” we're fitting models with Numident birth cohorts of 1910-1919

Possible Substantive Examples: 

* Black / White
* Male / Female 
* Home Ownership 

TODO 

* Figure out how would would expect modes to change for cohort over time (HMD data) 
* Try fitting STAN models with real data + covariates 
* Try fitting STAN models with real data + weights 
* Compare MLE and STAN estimates 


Call 20210303
--------------------------

TODO 

* Retry with different cohorts (10x)
* Random walk with drift 
* Compare with estimates from last group
